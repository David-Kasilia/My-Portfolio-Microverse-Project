We used Wave a web accessibility evaluation report tool to get more insight on the project.<br>

## Issues That were found on web accessibility
<ul>
<li>Page titles: Changed to more descriptive page title that perfectly describes my project.</li>
<li>Image text alternatives: Some Images had the same alternative text. I changed them to appropriate alternative text that fit the image.</li>
<li>Text headings: I changed a text heding that didnot qualify to be a heading and gave it a proper element.</li>
<li>Interaction: Added Lables for all the forms and set them to invisible.</li>
</ul>

## Issues That were not found on web accessibility
<ul>
<li>Resize: No issue found since the text resized well as the Firefox zoom works</li>
<li>Color contrast: No issue found since the template was to be the same with figma</li>
<li>The basic structure of the page: No issue found</li>
</ul>


# Run Tests
I tested the website by running the code to a live server and opened it with Mozilla Firefox.To ensure the Webpage was responsive and was in a mobile version with both sections. I used the developer tools to see if it was responsive.

I ensured that the forms can be submitted by confirming the details in formspree.
