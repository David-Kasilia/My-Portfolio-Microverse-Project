This Template from Figma had no about me section. I took into consideration the template from the Requirements Project The template given there. I tried to maintain the look and style of the page.

# Run Tests
I tested the website by running the code to a live server and opened it with Mozilla Firefox.To ensure the Webpage was responsive and was in a mobile version with both sections. I used the developer tools to see if it was responsive.
